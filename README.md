## üíª Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Monaco Editor, Axios
* **Backend (API Server):** Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB
* **Code Runner (Execution Engine):** Node.js, Express, Docker
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with HTTP-Only Cookies
* **AI:** Google Gemini API

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project is built on a microservice-oriented architecture to ensure security and scalability:

1.  **`client`:** A modern React single-page application that serves as the user interface.
2.  **`backend`:** The main API server that handles user authentication, problem data, submissions, and communication with the AI.
3.  **`runner`:** A completely isolated service that securely executes user-submitted code inside Docker containers. It receives code from the backend, runs it, and returns the result.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* Docker Desktop
* Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # Create a .env file and add your variables (see below)
    node index.js
    ```

3.  **Runner Setup:**
    * (In a new terminal)
    ```bash
    cd runner
    npm install
    # Build the base Docker images (only needs to be done once)
    node build_images.js
    # Start the runner server
    node index.js
    ```

4.  **Client Setup:**
    * (In a third terminal)
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

You will need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
# backend/.env

# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...

# A secret key for signing JWTs
JWT_SECRET=yoursupersecretkey

# Your Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your key
